# description
>We collect human explanations for
commonsense reasoning built on top of CQA and
introduce them as Common Sense Explanations
(CoS-E)1. CoS-E contains human explanations in the form of both open-ended natural language explanations as well as highlighted span annotations
that represent words selected by humans as important for predicting the right answer.
