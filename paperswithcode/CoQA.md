[CoQA: A Conversational Question Answering Challenge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07042.pdf)
# description
>The Conversation Question Answering dataset (CoQA)
Reddy et al. (2018) consists of documents from 7 different
domains paired with natural language dialogues between a
question asker and a question answerer about the document.
CoQA tests reading comprehension capabilities and also
the ability of models to answer questions that depend on
conversation history (such as “Why?”).
