# description
These dataets are usually used as benchmarks for link prediction. FB15K is the relatively dense subgraph of Freebase; WN18 is the subset of WordNet.
WordNet is designed to produce an intuitively usable dicitonary and thesaurus, and support automatic text analysis. Its entities(temred *synsets*) correspond to word senses, and relationships define lexcial relations between them.
Freebase is a huge and growing KB of general facts; there are currently 1.2 billion triplets and more than 80 million entities.
