>Instead, we created a new web scrape which emphasizes
document quality. To do this we only scraped web pages
which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually
filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive
so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from
Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3
karma. This can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for
whether other users found the link interesting, educational,
or just funny.
