# description
This wizard-of-wiki dataset contains multi-turn conversations from two participants. One participant selects a beginning topic, and during the conversation the topic is allowed to naturally change. The
two participants are not symmetric: one will play the role of a knowledgeable expert while the other
is a curious learner.
