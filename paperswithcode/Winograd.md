# description
>The Winograd Schema challenge (Levesque et al., 2012)
was constructed to measure the capability of a system to
perform commonsense reasoning by measuring its ability
to resolve ambiguities in text.

>In general, what we are after is a new type of Turing Test
that has these desirable features:
>* it involves the subject responding to a broad range of English sentences;
>* native English-speaking adults can pass it easily;
>* it can be administered and graded without expert judges;
>* no less than with the original Turing Test, when people
pass the test, we would say they were thinking.

# statistics
There are 150 Winograd schemas.
