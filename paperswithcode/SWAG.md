# description
>The Situations With Adversarial Generations
(SWAG) dataset contains 113k sentence-pair completion examples that evaluate grounded commonsense inference (Zellers et al., 2018). Given a sentence, the task is to choose the most plausible continuation among four choices.
# statistics
There are 113k multiple choice questions about a rich specturm of grounded situations.
